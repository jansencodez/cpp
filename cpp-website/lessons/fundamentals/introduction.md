# Welcome to C++ Server Development!

In this comprehensive course, you'll learn how to build production-ready HTTP servers using only C++ and system libraries. From basic socket programming to advanced server architecture, you'll gain the skills to create robust, scalable web applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand socket programming fundamentals and network protocols
- Implement HTTP protocol from scratch with proper parsing
- Build multi-threaded server architecture for high concurrency
- Master modern C++ design patterns and best practices
- Create RESTful APIs and handle different HTTP methods
- Implement error handling, logging, and monitoring
- Deploy and scale your server in production environments

## Course Overview

**Total: 28 lessons with 50+ code examples and hands-on exercises**

## Prerequisites

- Basic C++ knowledge (variables, functions, classes)
- Understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with command line tools
- Basic understanding of networking concepts

## What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll develop a complete HTTP server that can:

- Handle multiple concurrent connections
- Parse HTTP requests and generate responses
- Serve static files and dynamic content
- Implement RESTful API endpoints
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Integrate with databases
- Scale horizontally with load balancing

## Getting Started
